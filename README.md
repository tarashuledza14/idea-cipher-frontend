Getting Started
Welcome to the project! Follow these simple steps to get up and running.

Step 1: Install Dependencies
We use pnpm for dependency management, but feel free to use npm if you prefer.

Open your terminal and run:

bash
ÐšÐ¾Ð¿Ñ–ÑŽÐ²Ð°Ñ‚Ð¸ ÐºÐ¾Ð´
npm install
Step 2: Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:

bash
ÐšÐ¾Ð¿Ñ–ÑŽÐ²Ð°Ñ‚Ð¸ ÐºÐ¾Ð´
npm run dev
After the server has started, you'll see a URL in your console.

Important!
Before you visit that URL, ensure that the backend is up and running!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
