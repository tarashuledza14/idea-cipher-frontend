Getting Started
Welcome to the project! Follow these simple steps to get up and running.

Step 1: Install Dependencies
I use pnpm for dependency management, but feel free to use npm if you prefer. Also to start this project you must install nodejs =(

Open your terminal and run:

```
npm install
```
Step 2: Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:
```
npm run dev
```

After the server has started, you'll see a URL in your console.

If you want to use pnpm, you need to install it:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

and after use the same command just replace npm to pnpm =)

Important!
Before you visit that URL, ensure that the backend is up and running!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
